Slipknot - Psychosocial

I did my time, and I want out
So effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion, pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done, it has begun, I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me
[Post-Chorus: Clown, Chris Fehn, & Paul Gray]
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
